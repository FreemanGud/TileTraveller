# TileTraveller

In this assignment, you work in groups of 2-3 students each and apply pair programing. Moreover, you need to use git during the development of your solution.

The assignment is to develop a computer game in which the player is located in a certain tile in a grid.  At each iteration, the program displays the directions for which there are adjacent tiles that the player can travel to.  

The program only displays text, so you donâ€™t actually draw the tile grid, but the program should behave as if the player is in a 3x3 grid with open and closed walls as seen in the following image: ![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mimirplatform.production/files/e45359e9-60bf-4fd0-9b4c-dbed17591e5f/Screenshot%202020-09-15%20at%2018.30.51.png)
